settings
contains a list of numbers to append to "gbpsfc" to get the VMs' names

start [<name>]
stop [<name>]
list [<name>]
No parameters: machines' names are generated from settings.sh file (SFLOW_LIST should contain numbers used for vagrant's names of VMs).
One parameter: operation will take place on than machine only (ex., `start gbpsfc2')

start
Start sending sFlow data from OVS (all parameters are set in internal_settings.sh)

stop
Stop sending sFlow data

list
Show actual state of sFlow, or will not show anything if sFlow is stopped.

internal_settings.sh
Settings used to start sFlow sending on a machine

internal_start.sh, internal_stop.sh
Not to be run manually. Starting/stopping sFlow sending on individual machine



This has a lot of potential improvement...
